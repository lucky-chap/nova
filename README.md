## About


NovaüöÄ is a kanban board for productivity. It is a web based kanban planner with superpowers. Want to get some todos listed? We got you! What about some sorting of work? We got you there too!
Our drag and drop feature allows you to move items anywhere you like, making them your own üëç
Make use of our markdown editor too, it's pretty useful. Oh and, it also has a preview for markdown files built-in. ü§Ø

#### Why  I built this:

- I wanted something fancy for my portfolio ü§©
- I wanted to try out drag-n-drop libraries out there in the wild. I used `react-beautiful-dnd`
- I wanted something that I could rely on to save simple notes while working in the browser
- I wanted to know more firebase
- I was curious about how people made it, so I decided to use the same resources to make mine

I'm leaving the code available so you can feel free to host your own NovaüöÄ instance or study the code for learning purposes. If you got any questions, just hit me up:

- After the app is generated, the second step is to add the firebase SDK
- Copy the generated firebase SDK code
- Specifically copy the contents of the `firebaseConfig` object
- Now go into [.env.example](./.env.example)
- In the `firebaseConfig` object, replace the values of every key accordingly
- For example `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY= 'the value of the firebaseConfig.apiKey'`
- Do the same for the rest

#### Afte doing the above:
